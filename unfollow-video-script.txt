Hey everyone!ne!
If you’re tired of manually unfollowing hundreds of accounts on Instagram — this video is for you.
Instagram removed any option to ‘Unfollow All’, but I’ve got a safe and simple solution that still works in 2025.

All you need is your browser — no sketchy apps, no logins, no bots.

I’ll show you a small script you can paste into your browser’s developer console.
It automatically unfollows people for you, using human-like delays and even skips some accounts to mimic real behavior.

It also has a daily limit — so you don’t get flagged or banned.
And if you want to stop at any point, you just type one line in the console.

Everything’s transparent and customizable.
Let me walk you through exactly how to use it step-by-step.”
